# -BST-program
1) load the BST from a dataset (I will provide the datasets-see below) in the order they exist in the dataset.

2) after the BST is built analyze the BST and display the following values:

2.1) the smallest branch height

2.2) the highest branch height

2.3) the number of nodes in the tree

2.4) the determination if the tree is balanced

2.5) the determination if the tree is complete
